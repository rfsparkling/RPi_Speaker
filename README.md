Integrated active amplifier PCB for Rapsberry Pi (versions 1,2 and 3). On board LM386 amplifier do the amplification of the weak PWM audio signal coming out of RPi GPIO.
Also an on board low pass filter helps reconsturging the analog audio signal from PWM. 

Amplifier board built, find test video on Youtube here: http://bit.ly/rpi_speaker
